Welcome to the Friend Feast, where you don't dine ON your friend but WITH them!

----[ Why did we make this app? ]----
 
We love to eat together, but never know what to make. We hope that this app will help us and others coordinate meals and reduce grocery waste--we college students can't afford to waste food! Join a "Friend Feast" session with all of your friends to figure out what you can make together with everyone's combined ingredients!
