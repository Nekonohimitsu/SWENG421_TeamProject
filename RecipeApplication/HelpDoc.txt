Friend Feast Instructions
==========
Welcome to the Friend Feast, where you don't dine ON your friend but WITH them!

Why did we make this application? 
We love to eat together, but never know what to make. We hope that this app will help us and others coordinate meals and reduce grocery waste--we college students can't afford to waste food!

How to use this application:
Search - You can search for a recipe by using the recipe name or some key words. E.g. "Bacon and Broccoli Mac and Cheese" or "Mac and Cheese"
Recipe List - This is a list of available recipes. If you've added ingredients, you will see a percentage to the right of the recipe. This number tells gives you an idea of how likely it is that you can make that recipe using your current ingredients. 100% means that you have all of the required ingredients! 
Choose Recipe - Select a recipe with a single click. Modify a recipe with a double click.
Modify Recipe - You can change the recipe's name, prep time, cook time, ingredient list, and instructions.
Ingredient Replacement (Modify Recipe Feature) - If you have an allergy or food preference, you can select an ingredient and replace it. E.g. Replace [Milk] with [Almond Milk]
Add Ingredient - You can add your ingredients to the list.
